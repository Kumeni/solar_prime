                    Electrical load evaluation and calculation and electrical system design are two essential aspects of
                    any electrical project. Whether you're planning a residential, commercial, or industrial application,
                    accurately evaluating and calculating the electrical load is crucial to ensure that your system 
                    can handle the power requirements of your equipment and devices. Similarly, designing
                    an efficient and reliable electrical system is critical to ensure the optimal performance, safety, and
                    cost-effectiveness of your project. At Solar prime we do both load evaluation, calculation and
                    system design.

                <p>
                    Electrical load evaluation and calculation involve determining the amount of power that will 
                    be required to run the various electrical devices and equipment in your application. This process
                    takes into account factors such as the voltage, current, and power ratings of each device, as 
                    well as their expected usage patterns and peak demands. By accurately calculating the 
                    electrical load, you can ensure that your electrical system can provide reliable power without
                    overloading or causing damage to your equipment. Contact us today for your electrical
